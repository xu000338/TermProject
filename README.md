# CST 2216 TermProject
# Purpose:

This project takes the code in the credit_eligibility_model.py, real_estate_solution_model.py, ucla_neural_networks_model.py, and unsupervised_clustering_model.py Jupyter Notebook files and modularizes them into an organized data science project that preserves the functionalities of the original code in a user-friendly Streamlit web app.

# Libraries Required:
1. pandas
2. seaborn 
3.  matplotlib
4. pickle
5. streamlit 
6. sklearn
7. numpy
8. .logger


# To Run Application
1. Ensure all required libraries are installed
2. Open a Terminal window in the directory "./TermProject" (the directory this file is in)
4. The Streamlit app should open in a new browser window; if not, navigate to "http://localhost:8501/"
